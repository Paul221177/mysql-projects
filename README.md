# MySQL Projects 
This repository contains SQL scripts and queries I've worked on while practicing MySQL. 
 
## Examples 
- Data Cleaning (work 1.sql, work 2.sql, etc.) 
- Database creation (parks_and_recreation.sql) 
- Querying tables (joins, subqueries, aggregations) 
- Sample exercises and test cases
